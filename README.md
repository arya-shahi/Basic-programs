AIM :- downloading and installation of vs code ( hello world and calculator) <br>

Theory:- <br>

1). In this we installed vs code and ming w (from source forge) <br>
2). in this program we have printed hello world and find the sum , subtarction , multiplication and division of two numbers (user input), taking average of 5 inputs and gradingÂ them <br>
CODE:- <br>
A) <br>
#include <iostream>
 using namespace std;
 int main(){

    cout<< "HELLO WORLD";
    return 0;
 } <br>

 B) <br>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
     int a,b,x,y,z,w,r;
    cout << "enter the number:";
    cin >> a >> b;
    x = a|b;
    cout << "\nans is :" << x;
    y = a^b;
    cout << "\nans is :" << y;
    z = a&b;
    cout << "\nans is :" << z;
    w = a << 1;
    cout << "\nans is :" << w;
    r = a >> 1;
    cout << "\nans is :" << r;

    return 0;
} 
<br>
C) <br>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int m1,m2,m3,m4,m5,avg;
    cout << "enter the num :";
    cin >> m1 >> m2 >> m3 >> m4 >> m5;
    avg = (m1+m2+m3+m4+m5)/5;
    if (avg > 80)
    cout << "it is A+ grade";
    else if (avg > 60 and avg<80)
    cout <<"it is B++ grade";
    else if (avg < 60 and avg > 0 )
    cout <<"it is C grade";
    

    return 0;
}

Conclusion:
<br>
In this experiment we learned about basic programs in c++ <br>
